**Abundance lies in the FUTURE!** ----------- *Prof. N. Ekekwe*


All the articles in our Magna Carta points to one thing and only one thing:

That our current state, our evaluation, our progress by all  indices are still heavily constrained.

Our GDPs are underperforming, our scientific progress is below par and our economic models are not yet close to optimal; 

Our values, our construct of a peaceful society, the foundations of wealth distribution and many more are struggling to keep afloat.

However, there is a beacon, a clarion call, a signal, pointing to the FUTURE

It is a **FUTURE**  of boundless possibilities;
one of limitless adventure and exploration

A future where we stretch the laws of physics to the limit; where we apply scientific progress to the boundaries of unspeakable wealth and health; It is this future we seek; this is the future we will pursue…

Because, when we get there, we will suddenly realize that all the limitations around us were in our minds and were never realities
