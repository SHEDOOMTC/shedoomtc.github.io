A single mail brought me here unplanned!

In 2023, while serving my country in Ekiti State, Nigeria, I was invited by *Frontiers in Pharmacology* to host a research topic in Pharmacoepidemiology.

They must have seen the paper I had just published with Evaristus Odoh, Gerald Ozota, et al. on Adverse Drug Reporting among Pharmacist Interns in Nigeria ([link](https://lnkd.in/dahQjBwR)).

Excited to contribute to this field, I went on a hunt for topic editors 😊. That’s where I hit the rock. 

The journal required at least a professor in each continent representing LMICs (Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, etc). 

I couldn’t find sufficient numbers. Many professors declined, citing low recognition despite the enormous work involved.

It was in this rush that I mailed Dr. Onyinye Akunne, a postdoctoral researcher in South Africa. 

After a few exchanges by mail and a Zoom call, I forgot about the disappointment of topic editors and joined her fledgling organization — Qua Pillar Research Health Foundation (QPHRF).

Every time I sit at my table designing forms, sending or replying to emails, I remember that life can send us in many directions outside of our control.

Let’s all get ready for when the call comes knocking!
